Afterward the object will look like this:\n |  {\n |      x: 4,\n |      y: {\n |          z: 1,\n |      },\n |      version: 2,\n |  }\n |\n | The version does not have to be stored on the object if that is not\n | convenient, but it should be stored somewhere so that it can be passed in\n | again later when the object needs to be upgraded again.\n */\n\nexport default class VersionUpgrader\n{\n\n    /**\n     * Create\n     * @return {void}\n     */\n    constructor() {\n        this.changes = [];\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Add a version number and the mutation callback.\n     *\n     * The callback will receive the object given to `upgrade` and is expected\n     * to alter it if needed.
